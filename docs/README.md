## Ablation study of MEL.

The expected role of MEL is to exploit multi-dimensional features to represent the edge of each pair of event nodes in scene-dependent event relational graphs.
To investigate the practical efficacy of MEL, we conduct an ablation experiment on MEL under the same model structure and training conditions.
The result for ERGL without MEL is 72.87 &plusmn; 1.94, while that of ERGL equipped with MEL is 75.52 &plusmn; 1.47, which illustrates that MEL that provides the model with scene-dependent multi-dimensional edge features does benefit the model.
